            <p><b>Best Time to Visit: Fall (September-November)</b> is the ideal time to visit. The crisp weather and stunning autumn foliage provide the perfect backdrop for outdoor exploration. Golden hour in the morning and late afternoon offers the best natural light for photography.</p>
            <p><b>Comfortable Footwear:</b>
                Many of Columbus's landmarks are spread across the city, so prepare for plenty of walking. Opt for comfortable shoes to fully enjoy the architectural walking tours.</p>
            <p><b>Dining with a View:</b> After a day of sightseeing, enjoy a meal at <b>Upland Columbus Pump House</b>, a modern brewery located in a restored historic building along the riverfront. The blend of modern design with industrial heritage provides a relaxing atmosphere for unwinding after your tours.</p>
            <p><b>Book Early for Tours:</b> Both guided tours and entry to landmarks like the Miller House require reservations, particularly during peak seasons. Book your spots at least a week in advance to secure your preferred dates.</p>
            <p><b>Exploring Beyond Downtown:</b> While downtown Columbus is packed with modernist landmarks, don’t miss nearby architectural treasures like <b>Zaharakos Ice Cream Parlor and St. Peter’s Lutheran Church</b>, both offering unique blends of history and modern design.</p>
